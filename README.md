# Run Lizmap stack with docker-compose

Run a complete Lizmap stack with test data. 

- Lizmap Web Client
- QGIS Server
- Redis

**Note**: this is a sample configuration for testing Lizmap web client with QGIS and WPS features.

‚ùó**If you want to use it on a production server, you will need to make adjustments to meet your
production requirements.**

## Requirements

- Docker engine
- docker-compose v2 

## Quick start

Execute the commands below for your system and open your browser at http://localhost:8090.

### Linux

In a shell, configure the environment:
```
./configure.sh configure
```
Or if you want to test specific version (here last 3.6.x version):
```
LIZMAP_VERSION_TAG=3.6 ./configure.sh configure
```

Run lizmap:
```
docker compose pull
docker compose up
```

To run lizmap visible to another system, prefix the docker command with a variable. NB! This will be plain HTTP with no encryption and not suitable for production.
```
LIZMAP_PORT=EXTERNAL_IP_HERE:80 docker compose up
```

### Windows

In order to user Docker on Windows you may install [Docker desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)


If you have some distribution installed (Ubuntu, ...) in WSL, you can simply run the linux command as above, once in it.

Or in PowerShell, run the folloinwg command to set up some files
``` 
configure.bat
``` 
You can then launch the docker using
``` 
docker compose --env-file .env.windows up
```
Or if you want to test specific version, you can edit `.env.windows` and change (here last 3.6.x version):

```
LIZMAP_VERSION_TAG=3.6
```

## Running the first time

The previous commands create a docker-compose environment and run the stack

The Lizmap service will start two toys projects that you will have to configure in the Lizmap
interface.

See the [Lizmap documentation](https://docs.lizmap.com) for how to configure Lizmap at first run.

Default login is `admin`, password `admin`. It will be asked to change it at first login.

## Add your own project

You need to :
* create a directory in `lizmap/instances`
* visit http://localhost:8090/admin.php/admin/maps/
* in the Lizmap admin panel, add the directory you created
* add one or more QGIS projects with the Lizmap CFG file in the directory

## Reset the configuration

In command line

```
./configure.sh  clean 
```

This will remove all previous configuration. You will have to reenter the configuration in Lizmap
as for the first run.
