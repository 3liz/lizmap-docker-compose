# Run Lizmap stack with docker-compose

Run a complete Lizmap stack with test data. 

- Lizmap Web Client
- QGIS Server
- Redis

**Note**: this is a sample configuration for testing Lizmap web client with QGIS and WPS features: 
if you want use it on a production server you will need to make adjustments for meeting 
your production requirements. 

## Requirements

- Docker engine
- docker-compose
- make (optional in Windows)

## Quick start

Execute those commands above for your system and open your browser at http://localhost:8090.

### Linux

In command shell configure the environment
```
make configure
```
Or if you want to test specific version (here last 3.4.x version):
```
make configure LIZMAP_VERSION_TAG=3.4
```

Run lizmap:
```
docker-compose up
```

### Windows

In order to user Docker on Windows you must install [Docker desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)

You can execute same commands as Linux part given above if you use `make` (optional).

Or in command powershell execute:

```
docker-compose --env-file .env.windows up
```
Or if you want to test specific version, you can edit `.env.windows` and change (here last 3.4.x version):

```
LIZMAP_VERSION_TAG=3.4
```

## Running the first time

The previous commands create a docker-compose environnement and run the stack

The Lizmap service will start two toys projects that you will have to configure in the Lizmap
interface.

See the [Lizmap documentation](https://docs.lizmap.com) for how to configure Lizmap at first run.

Default login is `admin`, password `admin`. It will be asked to change it at first login.

## Add your own project

You need to :
* create a directory in `lizmap/instances`
* visit http://localhost:8090/admin.php/admin/maps/
* in the Lizmap admin panel, add the directory you created
* add one or more QGIS projects with the Lizmap CFG file in the directory

## Reset the configuration

In command line

```
make clean 
```

This will remove all previous configuration. You will have to reenter the configuration in Lizmap
as for the first run.

## Activating Postgis service

Postgis service may be activated by using the [profile option in docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#profiles)

Example:

```
docker-compose --profile postgis up
```

Note that the default admin password will be `postgres` and may be changed when creating the environment. You may also
change the host name alias of database (which default to `db.lizmap`)

Example

```
make configure POSTGRES_PASSWORD=md5<my_md5_password> POSTGIS_ALIAS=mydb.host.name
```

The database will persist as named volume `postgis_data`.

## Running lizmap as CNAB bundle app with Porter

1. [Install porter (latest)](https://porter.sh/install/)
2. Create the destination directory for installing lizmap files
2. Execute `porter install --reference 3liz/porter-lizmap:latest --param destination=<destination-dir> --allow-docker-host-access` 

where `destination-dir` must be an absolute path.

Note: if you install lizmap from the CNAB bundle you don't need to install docker-compose

Hint: Create `~/.porter/config.toml` (chmod 600) with the line `allow-docker-host-access = true`
